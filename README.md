# React + Vite

This is a react router project which uses Tailwind for CSS and react router is implemented here with mulitple pages which are linked with together 
1) If we add any text in user/... it will be displayed in a tab over the default Hello World.
2) I have used Outlet in between header and footer which will only load the inner content of the page and not refresh header and footer for every update over the page.
3) There is use of NavLink and Link tags instead of a tag to improve performance.
